        <p class="lead mb-4">This is our point of view. We live in one big coming of age movie. Our lives are one endless adventure filled with drama, laughter, and happiness. We aren’t worried about the future, a virus out to kill the population, or whether or not we will be able to see our friends again. We get to cram six of our closest friends into one four-seater car. The world isn’t in danger, and world peace is a thing. “Heroes” by David Bowie, even plays in the background during our moment of realization that we are at the peak of our lives. The only issue is that this isn’t our reality. It is what we wish it were.<br><br>

        From as early the 1950s, Coming of age movies have been an influence in our everyday lives. However by the 1980s through the 2010s, this aesthetic has grown and become more popularized. By this occurrence, Coming-of-Age movies have shaped the now teen culture. The majority of teens are now longing for adventure, the summer romance, and the late-night trips heading anywhere but home. They also paved the way to show the struggles of growing up. Coming of age films showcased the minds of teenagers and faced the hardships of everyday life. They focused on the highs and lows of growing up and especially the raging teen angst. None-the-less, these films shaped teens and the standards for the “high school experience,” leaving, some people “underwhelmed” during their high school years and others living the “dream.” Growing up and transitioning from childhood to “adulthood” is never easy, and in so Coming of age films demonstrate the whole change in outlook and the struggles your identity goes through.
	      Coming of age films generally feature a young character, typically a teen, who is confronted by mature content. Typically the young characters feel alone, and not understood, and in so embarks on the quest of self-discovery. In many cases, it’s the struggle of being gay or falling in love and trying to understand all these new emotions and feelings. Other times, it’s a change in who the young character is. They are often too trying to figure out who they are and where they belong. But in some cases, a Coming of age film can be about learning to live again after the person or thing you care about most is gone.<br><br>

        Having graduated High school less than a year ago, I myself “lived” in a coming of age movie, or so I fashioned my life after without intention. I was a “young protagonist” in my own story that felt lost and confused and wanted to escape my ordinary everyday life. I had the conflict, the secondary “love interest”, and I was a walking Abercombie and Fitch marketing promo. I had the best friends since middle school cliche and had a mentality like Ferris Bueller from Ferris Bueller’s Day Off or Peter Parker from Spiderman’s Far From Home. During the fall semester of my junior year in High School, my friends and I crammed all six of us into one small 4 seater car. We drove under the sunset, blasting the radio, and acting like we had not a care in the world. As quoted by Stephan Chbosky’s film, Perks of Being a Wallflower, at that moment, “I swear we were Infinite.”
